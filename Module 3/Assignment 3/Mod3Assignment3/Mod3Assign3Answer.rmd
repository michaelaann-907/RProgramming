#### Google Stock Price Plots  


The following is an analysis of Googleâ€™s stock price from October of 2019 to October of 2020. This will
include a scatter, line, bar, histogram and boxplot. All the plots represent the closing price on the dates listed on the x-axis.


```{r}
# Scatterplot
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Date, y = Close)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Close Price over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Close Price")

# Line Graph
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Date, y = Close)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Line Graph of Close Price over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Close Price")

# Bar Graph
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Date, y = Close)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Bar Graph of Close Price over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Close Price")

# Histogram
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Close)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Close Prices",
       x = "Close Price",
       y = "Frequency")

# Box Plot
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Close)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Close Prices",
       x = "Close Price",
       y = "Frequency")


# Line Graph with points
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x = Date, y = Close)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Line Graph with Points of Close Price over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Close Price")


#You have created many different plots of the same data but some are more helpful than others. 
#Based on the plots you created, which one do you find most useful and why?

```


I find the line graph with points to be the most useful.It makes the data easier to read visually. I like that it is like a scatterplot and linechart. It is easier to see the trends and see spikes or drops in the data.

#### Google Stock Daily Price Comparisons    



```{r Advanced Plots}
ggplot(GOOG) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=High, color="High"))+
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Low, color="Low"))


# Line chart with Open and Close variables
ggplot(GOOG) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Open, color = "Open")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Close, color = "Close")) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Open and Close Prices",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Price")




# Google Stock Daily Price Comparisons
## Area plot comparing High and Low prices

ggplot(GOOG, aes(x=Date, y=Close)) +
  geom_area(color="black", fill="blue", alpha=.2)



# Plots Date and Open variables
ggplot(GOOG, aes(x=Date, y=Open)) +
  geom_area(color="black", fill="green", alpha=.10)


#NewDataFile <- subset(ExistingData, Argument)
MayPrice <- subset(GOOG, Date > "2020-04-30" & Date < "2020-06-01")

ggplot(MayPrice, aes(x=Date, y=Close)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Close)), size = 3, vjust=-1)



# Create a subset for AprilPrice
AprilPrice <- subset(GOOG, format(Date, "%Y-%m") == "2020-04")

# Create a scatterplot of Date and Open price for April
ggplot(AprilPrice, aes(x = Date, y = Open)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Open), size = 2, vjust = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Date and Open Price for April",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Open Price")
