# Module 4 - Assignment 1
## Pierce, Michaela 
### Data Transformation



```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
state_income <- read_csv("state_income.csv")

```



#### State Incomes

In this section, I will create a subset of data from the `state_income.csv` file. I will be using the following variables (columns).


1. State_Name
2. State_ab
3. County
4. City
5. Type
6. ALand
7. Mean
8. Median
9. Stdev


```{r}
# Create state_income2 dataset with selected variables and rearrange column order
# using select() command to help get remaining columns
state_income2 <- state_income %>%
  select(State_ab, everything()) %>%
  select(State_Name, State_ab, County, City, Type, ALand, Mean, Median, Stdev) %>%
  rename(State = State_Name) # Rename the State_Name column to State

# using head() command to show first 10 rows of data of state_income2
head(state_income2, 10)

```


```{r}
# Rename columns
# Ex.) state_income2 <- rename(state_income2, new_variable_name = old_varaibale_name) 

state_income2 <- rename(state_income2,
                         SquareArea = ALand,
                         IncomeMean = Mean,
                         IncomeMedian = Median,
                         IncomeStDev = Stdev)

# Display the first 10 rows of the dataset
head(state_income2, 10)

```


```{r}
# Create a new dataset containing only North Carolina data using filter()
NC_income <- state_income2 %>%
  filter(State == "North Carolina")

# Display the first 10 rows of the new dataset
head(NC_income, 10)

```


#### NC Incomes

I will be using the NC_income dataset to create summaries of the incomes within North Carolina 
including summaries by county, city and type.



```{r}
# Arrange the NC_income dataset by County in ascending order using arrange()
NC_income <- arrange(NC_income, County)

# Display the first 10 rows of the arranged dataset
head(NC_income, 10)

```



```{r}
summary1 <- group_by(NC_income, County)  
summary1 <- summarise(summary1, mean = mean(IncomeMean)) 

summary2 <- NC_income %>% 
  group_by(City) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(IncomeMean))

summary1
summary2

```
Summary1 presents the average income for each county. It organizes the NC_income dataset according to counties and computes the mean of IncomeMean for each county.

Summary2 showcases the average income for each city. It organizes the NC_income dataset by city and computes the mean of IncomeMean for each city.
```{r}
# Create summary3 dataset using pipe operator
summary3 <- NC_income %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(IncomeMean))

summary3
```


#### Income Visualization


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Scatterplot for summary1 dataset (County income data)
ggplot(data = summary1, aes(x = County, y = mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Income", title = "Mean Income by County") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Based on the scatterplot, Wake County has the largest average income and Stokes County has the lowest average income. Surry County has the second lowest income.



```{r}
# Create AvgStateIncome dataset by grouping state_income2 by State_ab and summarizing using mean of IncomeMean
AvgStateIncome <- state_income2 %>%
  group_by(State_ab) %>%
  summarise(AvgIncome = mean(IncomeMean))

AvgStateIncome

# Filter AvgStateIncome to include only states with "N" in the abbreviation
AvgStateIncome_N <- filter(AvgStateIncome, grepl("N", State_ab))

AvgStateIncome_N

```



```{r}
# Scatterplot for AvgStateIncome dataset
ggplot(data = AvgStateIncome_N, aes(x = State_ab, y = AvgIncome)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "State", y = "Average Income", title = "Average Income by State")

```



Based on the scatterplot, New Jersey (NJ) had the largest average income, while Tennessee (TN) had the smallest average income.
