# Question 2: Finding and Manipulating Data
# 1) In this module, you were introduced to retrieving data from an atomic vector. The same concepts work
#for retrieving data from a data frame. Instead of having just a single number to designated the column
#(from the lecture, example[4] returned the fourth entry (or column) in our vector), you will need to also
#designate the row:
#Example[x,y] – where x is the row and y is the column
value <- Marketing[20, "SalesinThousands"]
