#==Question 2: Loading Packages and Plotting Data
# 1) Write the code to load the tidyverse package.
library(tidyverse)
# 2) Create an object called sales.
#sales <-
# 3) Add the following values to sales (in this order): 50, 150, 200, 100, 300, 250
sales <- c(50, 150, 200, 100, 300, 250)
# 4) Create another object called month.
#month <-
# 5) Add the following values to month (in this order): 1,2,3,4,5,6
month <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# 6) Use the qplot function to create a scatterplot with sales on the y-axis and month on the x-axis.
qplot(month, sales, geom = "point", xlab = "Month", ylab= "Sales")
# 7) Add the following comment to your script and answer the question on the same line:
#What month had the largest sales? What was the amount? Month 5 ; 300

#==Question 4: Data Frames
# 7) Create a new data frame called Yearly_Sales. This data frame #will contain two vectors with name for the
#first vector being month and the second vector being        #sales.For month, type out the abbreviation for the
#12 months of the year (e..g, Jan). For sales, add the following #values: 150.25, 258.54, 268.55, 122.52,
#987, 458.82, 667.23, 845.54, 586.78, 888.58, 756.12, 456.84.

#Open data frame from the environment pane.
#Which month had the most sales? May = 987
#Which month had the least sales? Apr = 122.52
# 9) Finally, add the code to the script that would create a qplot #with month on the y-axis and sales on the x
#axis (hint: to select a column of data you use the $ sign as in #yearly_sales$sales).
